# Automatically add issues and PRs to the organization project board
# Project: https://github.com/orgs/Gater-Robot/projects/1
#
# This workflow ensures all new issues and PRs are tracked on our project board.
# For this to work, you need to add a PAT or GitHub App token with `project` scope
# as a repository secret named `PROJECT_TOKEN`.
#
# To create a PAT:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
# 2. Generate new token (classic)
# 3. Select scopes: `repo`, `project`
# 4. Add as repository secret: Settings > Secrets > Actions > New repository secret
#
# Alternatively, use the built-in project auto-add feature in project settings.
