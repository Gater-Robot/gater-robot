# Worklog

## 2026-02-08
- Started implementation request.
- Saved approved implementation plan to `docs/SUBSCRIPTIONS_V4_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`.
- Created this `worklog.md` and will keep it updated during execution.
- Added `TODO.md` with active task tracking per your request.
- Installed pinned v4 dependencies in `@gater/contracts`: `@uniswap/v4-core@1.0.2`, `@uniswap/v4-periphery@1.0.3`.
- Next: align contract code with installed v4 interfaces and implement subscriptions contracts.
- Added subscriptions contracts under `packages/contracts/contracts/subscriptions`.
- Added `burn(uint256)` (MINTER_ROLE gated) to `SubscriptionDaysToken` and corresponding test coverage.
- Added Foundry script suite: mine salt, deploy infra, create product, demo buy/refund.
- Resolved v4 type-path compatibility and hardhat stack-depth issues (`viaIR` enabled).
- `pnpm --filter @gater/contracts build` now passes.
- Added subscription ABI/address exports in `packages/contracts/src`.
- Added subscription deployment schema file: `packages/contracts/deployments/subscriptions.json`.
- Added `scripts/sync-subscription-addresses.mjs` for operational address updates.
- Added Foundry test files for pricing and minter burn behavior.
- Hardhat JS/TS tests are not currently runnable due missing Hardhat test-runner plugin configuration; hardhat compile passes.
- Foundry test execution is currently blocked in this environment (`forge` binary missing).
- Updated `packages/contracts/README.md` with manual runbook, pre-flight checklist, and UAT checklist.
- Validation run: hardhat compile passes; hardhat test command runs with no configured JS/TS runner; forge tests/scripts blocked by missing `forge` binary.
- Attempted completion notification via `ntfy_send`; command failed because binary is not installed in this environment.
- Starting follow-up execution: Foundry install/run, Hardhat TS test-runner wiring, and local sub-store integration pass.
- Installed Foundry toolchain (`forge`, `cast`, `anvil`, `chisel`) via `foundryup`.
- Foundry uncovered mixed v4 type imports between `@uniswap/v4-core` and `@uniswap/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core`; normalizing all subscription imports to `@uniswap/v4-core`.
- Applying unified import strategy: subscription contracts/scripts use `@uniswap/v4-periphery/lib/v4-core` types, and Foundry remaps `@uniswap/v4-core` to the same tree for BaseHook/SafeCallback compatibility.
- Enabled Hardhat 3 Mocha test execution by adding `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-mocha` + `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers` and wiring plugins in `packages/contracts/hardhat.config.ts`.
- Fixed JS/TS contract tests for Hardhat 3:
  - removed invalid `networkHelpers.reset()` usage.
  - stabilized `SubscriptionDaysToken` decay assertions with same-connection time helpers and bounded bigint tolerance.
- Validation run (follow-up): `pnpm --filter @gater/contracts test` now passes with 12/12 tests.
- Validation run: `pnpm --filter @gater/contracts build` passes.
- Validation run: Forge suite passes (6/6) using `~/.foundry/bin/forge` / PATH-adjusted `pnpm --filter @gater/contracts test:forge`.
- Added contracts CI workflow `.github/workflows/contracts-ci.yml` to run Hardhat compile/tests plus Forge tests on PR/push for `packages/contracts`.
- Ran local sub-store verification step: `pnpm --filter @gater/sub-store build` passes (non-blocking Vite chunk-size warning only).
- Added local-first deployment support for users who prefer Hardhat chain:
  - `packages/contracts/script/DeployLocalSubscriptionsStack.s.sol`
  - `packages/contracts/script/DeployMockUSDC.s.sol`
  - package scripts + `.env.example` + `README.md` updates.
- Verified contracts stack after updates:
  - `pnpm --filter @gater/contracts build` passes.
  - `pnpm --filter @gater/contracts test` passes (12/12).
  - `pnpm --filter @gater/contracts test:forge` passes (6/6) when Foundry is on PATH.
- Added local sub-store token tools page (`/tokens`) with wallet add-token actions for:
  - SUB token using generated base64 SVG (+1 on gold coin).
  - fake USDC token using Circle official token logo SVG (scaled to 128x128, base64 embedded).
